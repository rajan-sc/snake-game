# Snake Game Project

The Snake game is one of the most iconic mobile games, originally popularized by the Nokia 3310. Our goal is to recreate this classic game, complete with a moving snake, food, and a scoring system.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: Control the snake using the keyboard arrow keys.
- **Food Consumption**: The snake grows in length as it consumes food.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of the player's score as the snake eats more food.
- **Game Over Conditions**: The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or its own tail.

## Getting Started

Breaking down the problem of building the Snake game into steps.

1. **Create Snake Body**: Create three squares on the screen, lined up next to each other to form the snake's body.
2. **Move the Snake**: Implement continuous forward movement for the snake.
3. **Control the Snake**: Use the keyboard arrow keys (up, left, down, right) to change the snake's direction.
4. **Add Food**: Place food on the screen at random locations.
5. **Detect Collision with Food**: When the snake collides with the food, a new piece of food appears at a random location, and the snake grows.
6. **Implement Scoreboard**: Update and display the score when the snake eats food.
7. **End Game Conditions**: 
   - End the game if the snake collides with the wall, displaying a "Game Over" message.
   - End the game if the snake collides with its own tail.
